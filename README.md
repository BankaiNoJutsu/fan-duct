# fan-duct
- Fan duct for Dan A4 SFX and Noctua L9i or L9a heatsink+fan.
- Designed in FreeCAD, printing in Anycubic i3 Mega
- Slightly taller fan duct than the standard Dan-provided design, allowing for a smaller air gap
- Provides "counter-sunk" screw holes
- Created by Jeremy Shaw

# future plans
- Improve the fitment between the Noctua A9 fan and the fan duct itself.
- Improve the height offset for the Noctua long length screws that were bundled with either this cooler or the L65, intended for use with 25mm thick fans (a common fan size), instead of the 14-15mm fans of the L9i and L9a heatsinks. The current design may allow the longer fan screws to hit the heatsink fins.
